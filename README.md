## Overview

Data is mostly used in cloud in all parts of the world. Question here arises is that what is cloud?



## What is a Cloud?
Cloud is a global network of servers that are located in different parts of the world acting as one massive hard drive. They are accessible over the internet. 

In today's world everything we are using from watching netflix to storing our data in gmail, everything is based on cloud technologies.

## Backing up data

When we backup our data it is sent to all servers across the globe. I can then access this data by connecting to the internet.

In short I can access my data anywhere and anytime.

## Risks related to cloud

1. My data is kept online, but what if I do not have internet accessibility??

2. Online data is exposed to many cyber attacks.

3. We do not have much power on our data as it is stored and managed by some third party.

## World without cloud

In early 2000s when cloud technologies were not common it was very difficult to start a business.

1. First we had to setup a complete infrastructure to handle our online services.

2. After this heavy investment on setting up we have tp spent a lot of money to manage the human resource to maintain and manage it.

3. Initially we have no idea about the size of the required setup and over the time it becomes very difficult to upscale or down scale it.

4. After all this very little time was left to focus on business.

## What is cloud computing?

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—like storage, databases, and processing power—over the internet, allowing users to access resources on-demand without managing physical hardware.

## Advantages of cloud computing

1. Easy scalability

2. Pay as you go.

3. More maintenance provided.

4. Robust disaster recovery measures.

5. More data security

6. Managing server.

7. Rent servers

8. No hidden charges.

9. Resources reside on some remote data center.



## What is a cloud provider?

A cloud provider is a company that offers cloud computing services, such as storage, processing power, and software, over the internet. Examples include AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud.

## AWS

AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a leading cloud platform that provides a wide range of on-demand computing services, such as storage, databases, and machine learning, allowing businesses to scale and innovate quickly without managing physical servers. It offers 220+ services.
